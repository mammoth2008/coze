## ðŸ”¨ Development

### 1. Run

> Tip: using `rushx` instead of `pnpm run` or `npm run`

The cozeloop project in `apps/cozeloop` is a React App, start development by running:

```bash
cd apps/cozeloop

rushx dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8090/](http://localhost:8090/) with your browser to see the page.

### 2. Build

The cozeloop project is built with [Rsbuild](https://rsbuild.dev/), and the config file is [apps/cozeloop/rsbuild.config.ts](./apps/cozeloop/rsbuild.config.ts).

```bash
cd apps/cozeloop

rushx build
```

### 3. Dependencies in workspace

As you can see, many dependencies listed in [apps/cozeloop/package.json](./apps/cozeloop/package.json) are versioned by `workspace:*`, which means they are maintained inner this repository.

Change the source code of workspace dependencies and the changes will work directly (sometimes re-run is required), since the cozeloop project depends the source codes rather than artifacts.
